# Monitor Geometry Algorithm
Used mostly for Processing-Java's FullScreen(), also for Websites

Summary Code
- Static Beginning
- Dynamic with noLoop()
- Dynamic with no overlap using DRAW()
- Procedural
- OPP: Processing-JAVA Constructor, Pure-Java Classes

Using Computer to Calculate ratios into variables
- Ratios for GUI, start coding to get a sense of those ideas
- Simple Console checking of math formulae
- Verification of visual data (similar to paper folding for answers in "Paired Game" below)
- Transfer Case study information to pseudocode and variables
- Linked In Soft Skills, develop portfolio


Dynamic Code (Procedural)

Notes
- use fractions to 12 and notice how some fractions repeat themselves

Progressions
- Case Study of GUI (Objects & Features)
- Ratio Coordinates for FullScreen()
  - Paper Folding Activity (fractions of 1/2, 1/3, 1/5, etc., to ~16th)
  - Paired Game: draw dot on paper, guess ratio coordinate, paper fold answer
- Using Case Study label ratio coordinates by sectioning out pieces to code (create to do list)
  - Redraw on separate sheet of paper and record ratio coordinates

- Pseudocode GUI (Objects-as-2D Shapes & Features-as-behaviors)
- Use variables to calculate (casting and formatting to console)

## Using the Consumable
- Minimum age depends on the level of dexterity (usually grade 4 for multiple folds)
- Fold to match up the box, not the corners of the paper (possible errors with photocopying on a cylinder)
- Provides immediate feedback to folder (either looks symmetrical or not)
- 2D Folds will maintain aspect ratio of original "box shape"
- Use WORD to approximate the given display-geometry (use displayWidth and displayHeight, outputted to console)

## Notes on Printable

**CATUION**: If this is changed, change the consumable

Purpose: envision the coordinate plane using ratios of display geometry
-	Note: for CS10 & CS20, we will use Full Screen
-	In CS30: we will develop a Procedure for comparing the size() with the fullScreen() geometry

Purpose: fold the paper in half (four times)
-	Using 12 Divisions on a Page is usually the minimum for ratios
-	Use back folding and creases
-	Emphasize fold with light pen line

Fold this paper to label both dimensions
- Width Dimension
- Height Dimension
- This might get confusing quickly, might use colour and legend

“The more ratios are used, the easier they become.”

Label the following fractions in order:
1/12, 1/8, 1/6, ¼, 1/3, 3/8, 5/12, ½, 7/12, 5/8, 2/3, ¾, 5/6, 7/8, 11/12

Understanding different fractions:
-	Fold once on one piece of paper, label
-	Fold twice on another piece of paper, label
-	Fold three times on another piece of paper, label
-	Fold four times on another piece of paper, label
- Last Paper: fold to 12 and label with all fractions, perhaps equivalent fractions

CAUTION: Advanced GUI Design tests these ratios on different screen sizes
-	On most screen sizes, it will look great
-	As the screen gets larger a boundary exists where the ratio needs to change
-	Same is true for “as the screen gets smaller”

Fun Fact: What is the most amount of times a piece of paper can be folded?
