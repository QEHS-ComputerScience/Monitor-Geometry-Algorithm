# Monitor Geometry Algorithm
Used mostly for Processing-Java's FullScreen(), also for Websites

Summary Code
- Static Beginning
- Dynamic with noLoop()
- Dynamic with no overlap using DRAW()
- Procedural
- OPP: Processing-JAVA Constructor, Pure-Java Classes

```

```

Progressions
- Case Study of GUI (Objects & Features)
- Ratio Coordinates for FullScreen()
  - Paper Folding Activity (fractions of 1/2, 1/3, 1/5, etc., to ~16th)
  - Paired Game: draw dot on paper, guess ratio coordinate, paper fold answer
- Using Case Study, section out pieces to code (create to do list)
  - Redraw on separate sheet of paper and record ratio coordinates

- Pseudocode GUI (Objects-as-2D Shapes & Features-as-behaviors)
- Use variables to calculate (casting and formatting to console)
